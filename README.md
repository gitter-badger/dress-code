# The Dress Code

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/zalando-dress-code/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/zalando-dress-code/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/zalando-dress-code/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The Dress Code is a style library / style guide which is designed for maintainability and modularity.

Used by Zalando Brand Solutions department to solve the challenge of consistency between multiple apps.

We open sourced the project because we think it's a good example of how collaboration between UX Designers and Developers is enhancing consistency and user experience with the help of technology.

* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
* [Development & Contributing](#development)

## Main Features

* Follows [BEM](http://getbem.com/) â€” Block Element Modifier methodology

* Follows [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) principles

* Built with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), that means:
    * Modular - import just what you need
    * Reusable - apply styles on your own components by using SASS mixins
    * Customizable - "tweak" the look and feel by overriding variables or extending existing classes

* Updated interactive demo site

We are always looking forward to **open source community feedback** and **contributions** especially about:

* browser/device compatibility bugs
